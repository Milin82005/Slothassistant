# [Sloth Assistant] 🎯

### Project Description
[Sloth Assistant is a fun, meme-style web project designed for proud procrastinators. Instead of helping you be productive, it replies with lazy, sarcastic, and hilarious comments. It features voice responses, random sloth facts, and meme drops to keep things entertaining. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s simple yet packed with quirky personality. Perfect for a useless hackathon that celebrates doing nothing with style!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In a world obsessed with productivity and efficiency, not everyone wants a serious digital assistant. There’s no fun, no sarcasm — just constant pressure to “do more.” What if we had an assistant that embraced procrastinati  on and made laziness feel rewarding?
]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Sloth Assistant is a humorous and intentionally unhelpful web-based assistant. Instead of giving reminders or tasks, it offers sarcastic replies, lazy voice responses, random sloth facts, and memes to celebrate doing nothing. It’s a light-hearted twist on productivity tools — built to entertain, not assist.]
